SVR-Data-Science-Project

A Python project demonstrating Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predictive modeling and data analysis. This repository showcases how SVR can be applied to real-world datasets using Python, with steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

🚀 Features

✅ Data loading and preprocessing

✅ Implementation of SVR using scikit-learn

✅ Feature scaling with StandardScaler

✅ Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²

✅ Visualization of SVR results

✅ Easily extendable for custom datasets

🧠 What is Support Vector Regression?

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for regression problems. Unlike other regression models, SVR tries to fit the error within a certain threshold, which makes it robust for datasets with outliers or nonlinear relationships.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn


Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MMohammadinia/SVR-Data-Science-Project.git
cd SVR-Data-Science-Project


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🧪 How to Run
Option 1: Run the script
python src/svr_model.py

Option 2: Explore in Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/SVR_Analysis.ipynb

📝 Use Your Own Dataset

To use your own data:

Replace or add your CSV file in the data/ folder.

Update the data loading path in the script or notebook.

Adjust feature and target column names as needed.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²)

These help you assess how well the SVR model is performing.
